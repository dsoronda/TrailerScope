# TrailerScope

TrailerScope is web SPA application with web API backend on which you can search for movie trailers.

## Requiremenets

- Use an API of an online movie database (e.g. IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes);
- Use an API of an online video service (e.g. YouTube or Vimeo);
- Create your own WebAPI as middleware to retrieve the results of both services and aggregate them;
- Cache the aggregated data for performance;
- Make the search as smart as you can;
- Optionally create a web page that uses your own web API to search and show movies with trailers.
- Use the development language of the vacancy you are applying for.

Tips

    Follow industry standards when building your own API
    Showing a lot of embedded videos on your web page increases page load time significantly

Bonus

    Add the option to share trailers on social networks;
    Make sure your website is secure and super fast;
    Create a contact form to request a trailer for a movie;
    Surprise us! Build something we haven’t thought of or what you think is a valuable addition;

NOTE: Try to remember and briefly document the decisions you made and why you made them. We can’t wait to pick your brain.
